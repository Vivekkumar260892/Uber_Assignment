1. Idea behind the ETL model and Assumptions:

a) ETL model

I have created an ETL process using AWS S3, AWS Redshift and Databricks platforms.
I have used AWS S3 buckets as the source of the data, Databricks clusters to process and transform the data using python and spark apis. Finally, Redshift as the data warehouse, that holds the data.
